# Instantly Service

Cold email outreach service via [Instantly.ai](https://instantly.ai/) API V2. Handles campaign management, lead upload, email account warmup, and webhook processing. Integrates with runs-service for cost tracking (BLOCKING).

## API Endpoints

### Campaigns
- **POST /campaigns** - Create campaign in Instantly + DB, log run (BLOCKING)
- **GET /campaigns/:campaignId** - Get campaign details
- **GET /campaigns/by-org/:orgId** - List campaigns for org
- **PATCH /campaigns/:campaignId/status** - Update status (active/paused/completed)

### Leads
- **POST /campaigns/:campaignId/leads** - Add leads (bulk), log run + costs (BLOCKING)
- **GET /campaigns/:campaignId/leads** - List leads
- **DELETE /campaigns/:campaignId/leads** - Remove leads

### Accounts
- **GET /accounts** - List email accounts
- **POST /accounts/sync** - Sync from Instantly API to local DB
- **POST /accounts/:email/warmup** - Enable/disable warmup
- **GET /accounts/warmup-analytics** - Warmup stats

### Analytics
- **GET /campaigns/:campaignId/analytics** - Fetch from Instantly API, save snapshot
- **POST /stats** - Aggregated stats by runIds

### Webhooks
- **GET /webhooks/instantly/config** - Returns webhook URL for BYOK customers (public)
- **POST /webhooks/instantly** - Receives Instantly events (verified by campaign_id DB lookup)

### Health
- **GET /** - Service info
- **GET /health** - Health check

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js 20 + TypeScript
- **Framework:** Express
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon) via Drizzle ORM
- **Email API:** Instantly.ai API V2
- **Testing:** Vitest + Supertest

## Database Schema

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `instantly_campaigns` | Campaign records |
| `instantly_leads` | Lead records per campaign |
| `instantly_accounts` | Email accounts + warmup status |
| `instantly_events` | Webhook events |
| `instantly_analytics_snapshots` | Campaign analytics snapshots |

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env  # fill in values
npm run dev
```

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start dev server (nodemon) |
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript |
| `npm start` | Run compiled app |
| `npm test` | Run all tests |
| `npm run test:unit` | Unit tests only |
| `npm run test:integration` | Integration tests only |
| `npm run db:generate` | Generate Drizzle migrations |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Run migrations |
| `npm run db:push` | Push schema to database |

## BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)

Routes with `clerkOrgId` context use the org's own Instantly API key via key-service's BYOK decrypt endpoint. If the org hasn't configured their key, the request fails with 422 — no fallback to the shared app key.

Account routes (`/accounts/*`) remain on the shared app key for service-level operations.

Webhook verification uses `campaign_id` DB lookup (each campaign UUID is unguessable and stored with its org on creation). No webhook secret is needed.

## Environment Variables

- `INSTANTLY_SERVICE_DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `KEY_SERVICE_URL` / `KEY_SERVICE_API_KEY` - Key service for API key decryption
- `INSTANTLY_SERVICE_API_KEY` - Service-to-service auth secret
- `WEBHOOK_BASE_URL` - Public base URL for webhook config endpoint
- `RUNS_SERVICE_URL` / `RUNS_SERVICE_API_KEY` - Runs service integration
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3011)

## Authentication

All endpoints require `X-API-Key` header except:
- `GET /` and `GET /health` (public)
- `GET /webhooks/instantly/config` and `POST /webhooks/instantly` (public webhook endpoints)
